Hi, I am *@rapsoulhaonan* (Haonan, Yang). I am semi-actively hanging out on [Zhihu](No account :))、[Github](http://github.com/rapsoulhaonan)、[Medium](https://medium.com/@rapsoulhaonan). I like outdoor sports and work-out pretty much. I hope all of you take good care of yourself anytime.

I am a semi-experienced software engineer where I graduated with bachelor's degree in computer science. I am working on full stack develement especially on iOS-end for a start-up which led by a professor from Umich. I've been to the states for almost 5 years. I am applying for grad school recently where I would appreciate an immersion of computer science, innovation, and entrepreneurship together. Good luck to me! 👉 contact me with [Portfolio](/portfolio)、[Github](http://github.com/rapsoulhaonan)、[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haonan-yang-1a908056/)
